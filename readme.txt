A plugin to replace Amazon Affiliate links in a *feed* with a URL to the post directly.

== Description ==

If you send your posts to your subscribers automatically, that is called a feed or RSS. It is against the terms of the agreement for Amazon Associates to send affiliate links in emails, any emails, even those automatic feed emails. So this plugin, scans your feed for any links to Amazon and replaces them with a link to your original post. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload `remove-amazon-affiliate-links-feed` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it! The plugin will do the rest. It may need a little time for the feed to be recreated.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this replace my existing amazon plugin? =
No. This will change the links in your post feeds (RSS) only. It will not add any amazon links to your posts.

= Why do I need this? =
If you are an amazon associate, using affiliate links, then you have agreed to their terms. Part of their terms state that you may not use affiliate links in your emails, even in those automatic feed emails. This plugin changes all those affiliate links so they point to the original post.
